## Installation
Users can install required libraries for this project using <code> pip install -r requirements.txt </code>
Python 3.9.7 is used for this project. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using AirBnB Seattle data to better understand:
1. What is the busiest time to visit Seattle?
2. Where are popular properties located?
3. What is the vibe of the areas in Seattle?

## File Descriptions
The <code>AirBnB Seattle.ipynb</code> is the notebook to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is a <code>utils.py</code> to run the necessary utilities functions.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@stephanie.lwy/airbnb-seattle-analysis-d7cb1cffbf78)
