## Installation
Python 3.9.7 is used for this project. Users can install required libraries for this project using <code> pip install -r requirements.txt </code>


## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using AirBnB Seattle data to better understand the area, the best time to visit Seattle, and the price to rent a AirBnB:


## File Descriptions
Guide others through the files in your repository

## Results
When your project isn't meant to be interactive or used for other projects, you should instead talk about the technical details of your project. What were your results? What did you do to improve them? What methods did you try? What worked? What didn't work?
