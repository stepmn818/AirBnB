## Installation
Users can install required libraries for this project using <code> pip install -r requirements.txt </code>
Python 3.9.7 is used for this project. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using AirBnB Seattle data to better understand:
1. What is the busiest time to visit Seattle?
2. What is the vibe of the areas in Seattle?
3. How has the price of AirBNB changed over time?
4. What features predict AirBNB price?

## File Descriptions

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here (TODO -  add a hyperlink here when the post is ready)
When your project isn't meant to be interactive or used for other projects, you should instead talk about the technical details of your project. What were your results? What did you do to improve them? What methods did you try? What worked? What didn't work?
